# Operation of a neuron

Items within a neuron include:

* Sodium-Potassium Pump
* Voltage Gated Ion Channels

## Sodium-Potassium Pump

During resting, pumps out Na<sup>+</sup> and pumps in K<sup>+</sup> through a membrane.

1. 3 Na<sup>+</sup> molecules binds to the pump.
2. ATP binds to the pump, which then deforms and pushes the Na<sup>+</sup> out
3. 2 K<sup>+</sup> bind to the membrane, which then resets and pushes them in.

This leads to a membrane potential as the inside is less positively polarised than the outside. The difference in electrostatic charge prevents any K<sup>+</sup> ions from leaving.

## Action Potential
