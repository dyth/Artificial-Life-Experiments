# ArtificialLife

A collection of code modelling biological phenomena that intrigue me. Most are implemented using FTDT simulations (Forward-Euler).

• conwayLife: Pygame implementation.
• CrowdSimulator1.jar: A crowd simulator of predator and prey moving around a 2D  world of food and traps.
• frankenstein: 3D representation of reaction-diffusion equation. Run with "java World".
• pacemaker: heart.py shows the synchronisation of neurons over time.
• vonneumann.py: self-replicating code.
