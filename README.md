# Simulations

## Artificial Life

A collection of code modelling biological phenomena that intrigue me. Most are implemented using FTDT simulations (Forward-Euler).

* `conwayLife.py`: Pygame implementation.
* `CrowdSimulator1.jar`: A crowd simulator of predator and prey moving around a 2D world of food and traps. Run using `java World`.
* `frankenstein.py`: 3D representation of reaction-diffusion equation.
* `pacemaker.py`: `heart.py` shows the synchronisation of neurons over time. This curious phenomenon was described in Sync, by Steven Strogatz. 
* `vonneumann.py`: self-replicating code.

## Other phenomena

* `traffic.py`: There is an expression `You wait a long time for a London Bus, and then two come along`. In order to prove the validity of the statement, this is a model of traffic patterns.
